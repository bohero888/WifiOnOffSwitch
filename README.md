Android WiFi On Off Switch App

This app allows you to switch your wifi on or off.

The app launches and has a simple screen showing a title "Wifi On Off Switch" in the top blue bar area. 
Right below in the body of the app is a text view labeled "Wifi is currently ON". 
Then below it is a toggle switch with with the label "Switch" to the left of it in the on position because the wifi is currently on.

When you toggle the switch it goes to the off position and the text above it reflects that position by saying "Wifi is currently OFF".

Now when you click the switch to turn it on a Toast Widget will pop up and let you know that "Wifi may take a moment to turn on".
Along with the text above the switch changing back to "Wifi is currently ON.
